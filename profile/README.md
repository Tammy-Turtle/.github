## 📖 The Mission
In elementary classrooms, children often face "big emotions" that they aren't yet equipped to process. **Tammy the Tattle Turtle** is an intelligent IoT companion that provides a safe, non-judgmental harbor for children to share their feelings. 

By combining **Socratic questioning** with **edge-AI hardware**, Tammy helps children navigate their thoughts while ensuring teachers stay informed through a smart safety-classification system.

## ✨ Impact Features

### 🤝 Safe & Socratic
Tammy doesn't just "listen"—she guides. She uses gentle validation and small, manageable questions to help children visualize a path from distress to calm.

### 🎯 Mission-Oriented 
Every interaction ends with a **"Mini-Mission"** (like a deep breath or a creative task), giving the child an immediate sense of agency and empowerment.

### 🚦 Smart Triage for Teachers
Tammy automatically categorizes interactions using a "Traffic Light" system:
- 🟢 **Green:** General socializing & happy updates.
- 🟠 **Orange:** Minor conflicts & academic stress.
- 🔴 **Red (CRITICAL):** Immediate safety concerns or physical harm.
